## About

This is my entry for the [NESDev Compo '23](https://itch.io/jam/nesdev-compo-2023).
idea 1: some kind of art gallery using fullscreen 2bpp graphics (mapper 96 esque)

## Compiling

Dependencies (these must be available in path):
- CA65
- LD65
- Mesen

Run the makefile in a suitable bash environment. For more detailed instructions, refer to Pinobatch's [NROM template](https://github.com/pinobatch/nrom-template). If no bash environment is available, run the make.bat file.
